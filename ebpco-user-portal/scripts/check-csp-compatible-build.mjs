/**
 * The built index.html must not rely on an inline event-handler attribute.
 *
 * `netlify.toml`'s CSP is `script-src 'self'` with no `unsafe-inline` and no
 * hash/nonce, so an inline handler (`onload="..."`, `onerror="..."`, etc.)
 * is silently BLOCKED by the browser rather than failing the build — the
 * exact shape of the defect this gate exists for. It happened for real: the
 * production build's own critical-CSS optimisation (Angular's Beasties,
 * enabled by default whenever `optimization` is not explicitly overridden)
 * defers the full stylesheet with
 * `<link ... media="print" onload="this.media='all'">`, so the CSP's own
 * `script-src` blocked the ONE inline script the page needed to make its
 * own stylesheet apply — the login screen rendered as unstyled HTML on the
 * live site for as long as this went unnoticed, because `ng serve`'s dev
 * server sends no CSP header at all and never reproduces it.
 *
 * Fixed by disabling `optimization.styles.inlineCritical` in angular.json's
 * production configuration (an explicit, plain `<link rel="stylesheet">`
 * has never needed a script to activate). This gate is the regression test:
 * it reads the REAL build output `npm run verify`'s own `npm run build`
 * step already produced, not a copy of it.
 *
 * Run: npm run check:csp (after a build; npm run verify already orders it there)
