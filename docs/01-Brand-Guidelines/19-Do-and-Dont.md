# Purpose

This document defines practical design rules for creating consistent, professional, and accessible interfaces throughout the eBPCO ecosystem.

Every UI review should validate compliance with these rules before implementation approval.

---

# Philosophy

When making design decisions, always choose:

- Consistency over creativity
- Simplicity over complexity
- Clarity over decoration
- Accessibility over aesthetics
- Reusability over one-off solutions

---

# Layout

## ✅ Do

- Align content to the grid.

- Create inconsistent layouts.
- Overcrowd pages.

---

# Typography

## ✅ Do

- Use the approved typography scale.
- Maintain hierarchy.
- Use sentence case.
- Ensure readability.

## ❌ Don't

---

# Colors

## ✅ Do

## ❌ Don't

- Use placeholder-only labels.
- Display unclear errors.
- Hide required fields.
- Create inconsistent layouts.

---

# Tables

## ✅ Do

- Maintain consistent actions.
- Use status badges.

## ❌ Don't

- Overload tables with unnecessary columns.
- Mix action locations.
- Hide important data.
- Remove sorting without reason.

---

# Cards

## ✅ Do

- Use approved card types.
- Maintain spacing.
- Follow elevation rules.
- Keep content organized.

## ❌ Don't

- Create decorative cards.
- Mix elevation levels.
- Place unrelated information together.

---

# Icons

## ✅ Do

- Pair icons with labels.
- Maintain consistent sizing.

---

# Navigation

## ✅ Do

## ❌ Don't

- Create dead-end screens.
- Change navigation patterns.
- Hide important actions.

---

# Accessibility

## ✅ Do

- Support keyboard navigation.
- Maintain WCAG AA contrast.
- Display focus indicators.
- Use descriptive labels.

## ❌ Don't

- Remove focus outlines.
- Depend solely on color.
- Ignore screen readers.
- Reduce touch targets below 44×44px.

---

# Motion

## ✅ Do

- Keep animations subtle.
- Maintain consistent timing.
- Use motion to support usability.

## ❌ Don't

- Add decorative animations.
- Delay workflows.
- Overanimate components.
- Use flashing effects.

**Exception — Angular Web Admin Portal:** per the approved Maximalist Motion Exception (see `02-Design-System/10-Motion.md`), this platform intentionally uses denser, more visible motion than the baseline rule above — staggered reveals, count-up numbers, chart draw-ins, a kinetic headline treatment on brand screens. This exception is scoped to the Angular Web Admin Portal only; the "keep animations subtle" / "avoid decorative animations" rules above remain the default for every other eBPCO surface, and even within the Admin Portal's exception, every animation must still be traceable to a specific usability purpose — confirming an action, guiding attention, or communicating a state change. Purely ornamental motion is still out of scope, exception or not.

---

# Component Creation

## ✅ Do

- Check the Component Library first.
- Reuse existing components.
- Request approval for new components.

## ❌ Don't

- Create undocumented components.
- Duplicate existing functionality.
- Bypass the Design Foundation.

---

# AI-Assisted Development

## ✅ Do

- Follow Design Tokens.
- Use registered component IDs.
- Respect the Brand Guidelines.
- Follow the Stitch documentation.
- Generate reusable components.

## ❌ Don't

- Invent new UI patterns.
- Ignore accessibility.
- Hardcode design values.
- Create undocumented workflows.
