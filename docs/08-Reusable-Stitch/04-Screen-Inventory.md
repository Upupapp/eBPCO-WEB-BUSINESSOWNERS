# Screen Inventory

Version: 1.0.0
Status: Draft
Document Owner: System Architect

Category: Reusable Stitch

# Purpose

This document defines the complete inventory of screens within the Electronic Business Permit and Clearance Office (eBPCO).

Unlike the Application Map, which illustrates how reusable stitches connect, the Screen Inventory identifies every user-facing screen, its purpose, ownership, and the stitch to which it belongs.

This inventory serves as the master reference for UI/UX design, frontend development, testing, and AI-assisted generation.

---

# Objectives

The Screen Inventory aims to:

- Document every application screen.
- Prevent duplicate screen creation.
- Define ownership of each screen.
- Associate screens with reusable stitches.
- Maintain consistency across Web and Mobile.
- Support project planning and testing.

---

# Screen Classification

Screens are grouped into the following categories:

- Public
- Shared
- Business Owner
- Administrative
- System

Each screen belongs to one reusable stitch.

# Screen Metadata

Every screen should have a corresponding specification document containing:

- Screen ID
- Screen Name
- Purpose
- Associated Stitch
- User Roles
- Entry Points
- Exit Points
- UI Components
- Navigation
- Validation Rules
- Business Rules
- API Endpoints
- Screen States
- Acceptance Criteria

Detailed specifications are documented separately to avoid duplication.

---

# Naming Convention

Screen IDs follow this format:

```text
<Category Prefix>-<Sequential Number>
```

Example:

```text
PER-001
```

Where:

- PER = Permit
- 001 = Sequential Identifier

This convention ensures consistency across design files, source code, documentation, testing artifacts, and issue tracking.
